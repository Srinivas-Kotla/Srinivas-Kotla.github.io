					<p>
					I am writer, designer, and teacher whose fiction and essays examine the role of dignity, beauty, and myth in the digital age. Trained as a graphic designer and arts educator, his work often addresses the relationship between the image, philosophy, and the psyche. His first book, The Road to Somewhere: An American Memoir, was published by W. W. Norton after traveling 50,000 miles along the back roads of America. His second book, The Manufactured History of Indianapolis, is a collection of fables about the Circle City. He is currently finishing his first novel, Riot and Devotion, a meditation on violence, myth, and compassion in uncertain times.

					Since 2004, I has taught graduate and undergraduate courses in philosophy, the history of art, and the politics of design at Bard Early College, Parsons School of Design, and Pratt Institute. He is the principal designer at Motorway, a creative studio. He has exhibited his work and lectured in New York, Helsinki, Indianapolis, Detroit, Philadelphia, Hong Kong and Grenoble.
